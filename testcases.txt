Test E and F are both stepping tests which will increment the size
of data requested along with their respective for loop.

Test E will request a malloc of size (loop counter).
Test E will then free.
It will do this 1000 times.

Test F will request a malloc 1000 times of size (loop counter).
Test F will then free 1000 times.

These tests were included to show the handling of much larger byte
size requests to malloc, if any change in time would be seen between
similar tests like A and B where much smaller amounts of data were
collected, and also in the case of Test F show how much faster the
allocated memory fills up compared to test A when nothing is freed
to allow for new requests.
